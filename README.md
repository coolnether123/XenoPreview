# XenoPreview

Supports RimWorld 1.6, 1.5, and 1.4

XenoPreview adds a dynamic live preview window to the xenotype creation screen. As you select genes, instantly see exactly how your custom xenotypes will appear in-game. Each gender has an individual lock feature, allowing separate rerolls and rotation to help you achieve the perfect appearance. You can also toggle apparel and tattoos (tattoos enabled when Ideology DLC is active) for a clearer view, and minimize the preview window when not needed.

This mod is fully safe to add or remove from your saves at any point without any risk of issues.
